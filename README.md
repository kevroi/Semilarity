# Semilarity
## Overview
A natural language processing python program that collects BBC news articles and uses a neural network to calculate the semantic similarities and distances to place concepts in an abstract metric space from the perspective of the journalists' semantics and search engine's scope.

## Usage
As of the last commit, the python script containing the entire program is stored in `main.py`.
`keywords.xlsx` stores the ten keywords that are input into the program. Support for a variable number of keywords will be added soon.
